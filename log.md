# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Monday, July 24, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked through about 50% of Codecademy "Learn HTML and CSS" course. Good review of basics.

**Thoughts:** Going to give 100-Days-of-Code another shot. Failed miserably last time, but I have some website ideas that I want to pursue. I previously worked a bit in HTML/CSS, but this was a good review  to get back into things.

### Day 1: Tuesday, July 25, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed Codecademy "Learn HTML and CSS" course. Began working on the "Make a Website" course sequence.


**Thoughts:** Made it to Day 1. Enjoyed getting a bit of accomplishment by finishing a Codecademy course. Very much looking forward to getting to the point where I can remember how to update my personal website. Goal is to have some updates on there within 1 week.

### Day 2: Wednesday, July 26, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed Codecademy "Build a Website" course. Enjoyed learning about the Bootstrap framework. Began the "Full Stack" path with Codecademy/Pro. First course in it is again some more HTML/CSS (I can use the review).


**Thoughts:** I really enjoyed learning about the Bootstrap framework. It is obvious how it provides excellent capabilities for quickly building basic websites. I decided to go ahead and pay for the Pro features at Codecademy to be able to get access to additional projects that I can use to practice on.

### Day 3: Thursday, July 27, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Coded for about 2 hours tonight. Approximately 1/3 of the way through "HTML/CSS" course in the Codecademy/Pro "Full Stack" path. Lots of review.

**Thoughts:** I'm really anxious to move on to more advanced topics like Javascript and JQuery. I know all of this HTML/CSS review/practice is good though as it is committing it to memory. I plan to trudge through the rest of this course in the next couple of days and then get on to more exciting topics!

### Day 4: Monday, July 31, 2017

**Today's Progress** Finished up coursework portion of "HTML/CSS" course in Codecademy/Pro "Full Stack" path. Began working on some of the interactive projects and planning my final project. Also explored WebStorm IDE to see how it worked with HTML. I'm going to use it for my HTML/CSS project.

**Thoughts:** Unfortunately missed 3 days in a row! I feel like I made up for that with almost 3 hours of programming tonight. I'm glad that I was able to get back going again. I'm looking forward to working on my final project for the HTML/CSS course.

### Day 5: Tuesday, August 01, 2017

**Today's Progress** Worked on some more HTML/CSS/Bootstrap projects in Codecademy. Also setup my first GitHub Page to host my personal website.

**Thoughts:** The Bootstrap framework is extremely useful. I'm nearly ready to put together my personal website. Feeling more comfortable with using HTML/CSS correctly (I have used it before, but not did not understand nearly this well).
