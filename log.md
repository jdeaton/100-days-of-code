# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Monday, July 24, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked through about 50% of Codecademy "Learn HTML and CSS" course. Good review of basics.

**Thoughts:** Going to give 100-Days-of-Code another shot. Failed miserably last time, but I have some website ideas that I want to pursue. I previously worked a bit in HTML/CSS, but this was a good review  to get back into things.

### Day 1: Tuesday, July 25, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed Codecademy "Learn HTML and CSS" course. Began working on the "Make a Website" course sequence.


**Thoughts:** Made it to Day 1. Enjoyed getting a bit of accomplishment by finishing a Codecademy course. Very much looking forward to getting to the point where I can remember how to update my personal website. Goal is to have some updates on there within 1 week.
