# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Monday, July 24, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked through about 50% of Codecademy "Learn HTML and CSS" course. Good review of basics.

**Thoughts:** Going to give 100-Days-of-Code another shot. Failed miserably last time, but I have some website ideas that I want to pursue. I previously worked a bit in HTML/CSS, but this was a good review to get back into things.
